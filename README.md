# Cats

Everyone needs a daily dose of cats in their life.   Using React, create an app that utilizes https://aws.random.cat/meow to view random cat pics.

A user should be able to login to view random cat pics (static email and password is fine)
- There should be the ability to view new random cat pics
- The user should be able to “favorite” a random cat pic and display their favorites
- The user should be able to logout when done viewing cats
- When the user logs back in, their favorites should still be available

Feel free to utilize create-react-app or any 3rd party libraries that will assist in the completion of this project.
